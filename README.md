📊 Power BI Dashboard Project – Prime Video Content Analytics

I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project where I analyzed and visualized Prime Video’s content library. This dashboard provides key insights into total titles, genres, ratings, directors, and global content distribution. It also highlights movie vs. TV show trends and release year patterns.
This project involved extensive data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. It reflects my ability to transform large datasets into meaningful insights and present them through clean, interactive visuals.
